# DiscordBot

This program is a DiscordBot, that I'm currently working on in order to get more experience using javascript and interacting with discord!

After planning what to do with this bot, I've decided we should have the following implementations:

## IMPLEMENTATION

1. Job Salary Search
   - Depending on which field you are as a student, you may want to know what is the pay for the work that your career unveils.
2. Play :white_check_mark:
   - If you would like to watch a movie or video that is already on discord, this bot has you covered!
3. Whois (used similarly in the great dyno bot: https://dyno.gg/) :white_check_mark:
   - Retrieves the Joined Date
   - Retrieves the Creation Date
4. AI Chatbot
   - If a user was to message the bot, they should provide normal results like the weather or wikipedia page.
5. Directionsâ€‹ :white_check_mark:
   - If a user asks for directions from a particular address, an image of that
   address and UNSW path will be generated using MapBox Direction's API.
   - The map is outputted as an embed.
6. Weather (used similarly in the marveled alphabot system  https://www.alphabotsystem.com/alpha-bot) :white_check_mark:
  - If a user would like to retrieve weather details from a particular city they can do so.
  - The current, forecasted max and min temperatures are retrieved.
  - A map of the location is outputted in a embed.
7. Prefix Updater:white_check_mark:
   - Since discord channels may have multiple prefixes with their server bots (clashes), they may want to change what this bot's prefix is.
