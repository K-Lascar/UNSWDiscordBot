# DiscordBot

This program is a DiscordBot, that I'm currently working on in order to get more experience using javascript and interacting with discord!

After planning what to do with this bot, I've decided we should have the following implementations:

## IMPLEMENTATION

1. Job Salary Search
   - Depending on which field you are as a student, you may want to know what is the pay for the work that your career unveils.

2. Play
   - If you would like to watch a movie or video that is already on discord, this bot has you covered!
3. Whois
   - Retrieves the Joined Date
   - Retrieves the Creation Date
4. AI Chatbot
   - If a user was to message the bot, they should provide normal results like the weather or wikipedia page.
